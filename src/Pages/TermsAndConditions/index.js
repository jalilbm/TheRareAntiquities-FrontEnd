                                        The United Arab Emirates and most other countries have
                                        regulations regarding the importation and export of tangible
                                        property.&nbsp;For property leaving the country, many countries
                                        require a declaration to export.&nbsp;Most countries also
                                        require an Import Declaration to be completed at the time of
                                        customs clearance for property imported into their
                                        country.&nbsp;These countries can impose duties, taxes, and/or
                                        restrictions upon the import of property.&nbsp;Many countries
                                        prohibit or restrict the importation or exportation property
                                        that contains ivory, tortoiseshell or whalebone. These products,
                                        as well as those derived from endangered or protected species,
                                        require special licenses and permits to import and export these
                                        property.&nbsp;Some countries have regulations regarding the
                                        movement of cultural and antiquities, which may be subject to
                                        compulsory purchase or pre-emption by the country where they are
                                        being exported.&nbsp;The seller is responsible for ensuring that
                                        the item is legally and properly exported from the country where
                                        it is located.&nbsp;The buyer is responsible for ensuring that
                                        the property is imported properly into their country.&nbsp;You
                                        agree to comply with all rules and regulations if you
                                        participate in the commerce or auction sections of the Web site.
